    <h1>TAGS</h1>

      <p>
        I understand HTML tag marks as information with an opening and closing tag.  These tags form a container in which you can hold information.
        I think of tags as a box in which you can store stuff, including other tags.
        When you place a tag within the bounds marked by another tag, you are NESTING the first tag within the second tag.
        It is like nesting one box inside of another box.  Another example of this is like the russian dolls in which you can stack one inside of another.
      </p>

      <p>Here is a <b>BOLD</b> word nested within a paragraph.</p>

      <p>Here is an example of this code. &lt;p&gt; Here is a &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; word nested within a paragraph.</p>

      <h1>PARAGRAPH ELEMENT</h1>

      <p>
        In HTML their is the &lt;p&gt; element which represents a paragraph.
        Paragraphs are blocks of text and/or images and form fields.
        Paragraphs are block elements and will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing of the &lt;/p&gt; element.
        &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag of the p element and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag of the p element.
        They relate to one another because thay set the boundaries of the paragraph element and anything within the &lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt; tags
        will show up as text, images, forms, etc.
      </p>
    <h1>THE ANCHOR ELEMENT</h1>
      <p>The HTML &lt;a&gt; element or anchor element, with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses,
         locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.  Content within each  &lt;a&gt; should indicate the link's destination.
      </p>
    <h1>HTML ATTRIBUTES</h1>
      <p>All HTML elements can have attributes and attributes provide additional information about elements.
         Attributes are always specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</p>
    <h4>THE href ATTRIBUTE</h4>
      <p>The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink.  The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:</p>
    <h4>href EXAMPLE</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools for more info</a>
         <br> Example Code: &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools for more info&lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <h4>THE src Attribute</h4>
      <p>
        The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
        The src attribute specifies the path to the image that you wish to display.
        You can also use width and height attributes within an img tag.
        These attributes specifie the width and height of an image in pixels.
        <br> <img src="james.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="A Picture Of James">
        <br> Example Code: <code>&lt;img src="james.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="A Picture Of James"&gt;</code>
      </p>
    <h4>THE alt ATTRIBUTE</h4>
      <p>
        The alt attribute is required for the &lt;img&gt; tag because it specifies an alternative text for an image.
        If an image for some reason cannot be displayed on your site the alt attribute for the &lt;img&gt; will show text instead.
        Errors with an image can occur with slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
        The alt attribute is shown in the example code above.  See below what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="img_none.jpg" alt="There Is No Picture"> <br>
        Example Code: &lt;img src="img_none.jpg" alt="There Is No Picture"&gt;
      </p>
