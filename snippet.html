      Want to search the web?
      Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some resources to help you understand each of these tags:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">This</a> resource is for information on the <code>a</code> tag!</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p#:~:text=The%20HTML%20element%20represents,as%20images%20or%20form%20fields.">This</a>
      resource is for information on the <code>p</code> tag!</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      The above code looks like this: &lt;p&gt; Want to search the web?
      Try &lt;a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      There are are two tags in the above section.
      The first tag is the paragraph tag/element which has the opening tag of  &lt;p&gt; and closing tag of &lt;/p&gt;.
      These tags are used to form blocks.  Paragraphs are blocks of text and/or images and form fields.
      Paragraphs are block elements and will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing of the &lt;/p&gt; element.
      &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag of the p element and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag of the p element.
      They relate to one another because thay set the boundaries of the paragraph element and anything within the &lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt; tags
      will show up as text, images, forms, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second tag in the code above is the &lt;a&gt; tag.  The HTML &lt;a&gt; element or anchor element, with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses,
      locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.  Content within each  &lt;a&gt; should indicate the link's destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three attributes in the &lt;a&gt; above.  The three attributes are id, class, and target.
    </p>
    <p>
      The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).
      The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.
      The id attribute above has a value of <b>"the best link"</b>, which gives it the id of "the best link"
    </p>
    <p>
      The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.
      The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.
      However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.
      The class attribute above has a value of <b>"banana"</b>, which means it will go to a css or java script file of banana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
      There are four target attributes that can be used.  "_blank" Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
      "_self"	Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default).
      "_parent"	Opens the linked document in the parent frame.
      "_top"	Opens the linked document in the full body of the window.
      The value in the target attribute above is <b>"_blank",</b> which means it will open in a new window or tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      The relationship between the opening and closing tags for the <code>p</code> tag, is to signify when to start the paragraph, and when to end it.

      The relationship between the opening and closing tags for the <code>a</code> tag, is to show where to start the reference to the link and where the link,
      and any comment attached to it, will end.
    </p>

    <p>
      The attributes on the <code>a</code> tag are: href, id, class, and target. These are their values and its effect:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>href</b>:
          -This is used to say that the destinaton of the link is google </li>
        <li><b>id</b>:
           -This is used to point just out one thing in the code that can be changed</li>
        <li><b>class</b>:
          -This is used to pick out multiple things within the code to be changed</li>
        <li><b>target</b>:
          -This is used to say where the link will open up at. In this case it will open in a new tab</li>
      </ul>
